.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmcli
is a command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and getting its status.
It is not meant as a replacement of \fInm-applet\fP or other similar clients.
Rather it's a complementary utility to these programs.
The main \fInmcli\fP's usage is on servers, headless machines or just for
power users who prefer the command line.
.P
The use cases comprise:
.IP \(em 4
Initscripts: ifup/ifdown can utilize NetworkManager via \fInmcli\fP instead of
having to manage connections itself and possible interfere with NetworkManager.
.IP \(em 4
Servers, headless machines: No GUI is available; then \fInmcli\fP is used to
talk directly to NetworkManager and control only system-wide connections.
.IP \(em 4
User sessions: For this case, \fInmcli\fP can talk to \fInm-applet\fP to find
user connections.  It can still talk directly to NetworkManager for manipulating
these connections.  As \fInmcli\fP doesn't have direct access to user
configuration data in GConf, \fInm-applet\fP handles that itself.  That may,
for example, cause the applet to pop up keyring dialogs when secrets are needed.
.SS \fIOPTIONS\fP
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-terse
Output is terse.  This mode is designed and suitable for computer (script)
processing.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pretty
Output is pretty.  This causes \fInmcli\fP to produce easy readable outputs
for humans, i.e. values are aligned, headers are printed, etc.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode tabular | multiline
Switch between \fItabular\fP and \fImultiline\fP output.
If omitted, default is \fItabular\fP for most commands.  For the commands
producing more structured information, that cannot be displayed on a single
line, default is \fImultiline\fP. Currenly, they are:
.br
.nf
  'nmcli con list id|uuid <name>'
  'nmcli dev list'
.fi
\fItabular\fP   - Output is a table where each line describes a single entry.
Columns define particular properties of the entry.
.br
\fImultiline\fP - Each entry comprises more lines, each property on its own line.
The values are prefixed with the property name.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fields <field1,field2,...> | all | common
This option is used to specify what fields (column names) should be printed.
Valid field names differ for specific commands. List available fields by
providing an invalid value to the \fI--fields\fP option.
.br
\fIall\fP is used to print all valid field values of the command.
\fIcommon\fP is used to print common field values of the command.
If omitted, default is \fIcommon\fP.
The option is mandatory when \fI--terse\fP is used.  In this case, generic
values \fIall\fP and \fIcommon\fP cannot be used.  (This is to maintain
compatibility when new fields are added in the future).
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-escape yes | no
Whether to escape ':' and '\\' characters in terse tabular mode.  The escape
character is '\\'.
If omitted, default is \fIyes\fP.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show \fInmcli\fP version.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information.
.SS \fIOBJECT\fP
.TP
.B nm
NetworkManager
.br
Use this object to inquire and change state of NetworkManager.
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { status | sleep | wakeup | wifi | wwan }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B status
.br
Show overall status of NetworkManager.  This is the default action, when no
command is provided to \fInm\fP object.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B sleep
.br
Put NetworkManager to sleeping mode.  Thus all interfaces that NetworkManager
manages are deactivated.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
interface: org.freedesktop.NetworkManager
method:    Sleep
arguments: TRUE
.fi
.TP
.B wakeup
.br
Awake NetworkManager from sleep.  When NetworkManager is awaken, devices are
available to be activated.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
interface: org.freedesktop.NetworkManager
method:    Sleep
arguments: FALSE
.fi
.TP
.B wifi [on|off]
.br
Inquire or set status of WiFi in NetworkManager.  Without any further argument,
WiFi status is printed; \fIon\fP enables WiFi; \fIoff\fP disables WiFi.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B wwan [on|off]
.br
Inquire or set status of WWAN in NetworkManager.  Without any further argument,
WWAN status is printed; \fIon\fP enables WWAN; \fIoff\fP disables WWAN.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi

.TP
.B con
Connections
.br
Get information about NetworkManager's connections.
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { list | status | up | down }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B list [id <id> | uuid <id> | system | user]
.br
List configured connections.  Without a parameter, configured connection from
both system and user settings services are listed.  \fIsystem\fP argument filters
only system-wide connections, \fIuser\fP prints user connections only.
In order to get connection details, \fIid\fP with connection's name or \fIuuid\fP
with connection's UUID shall be specified.
When no command is given to \fIcon\fP object, the default action is 'nmcli con list'.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B status
.br
Print status of active connections.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B up id <id> | uuid <id> [iface <iface>] [ap <hwaddr>] [\-\-nowait] [\-\-timeout <timeout>]
.br
Activate a connection.  The connection is identified by its name using \fIid\fP
or UUID using \fIuuid\fP.  For requiring particular device to activate
the connection on, \fIiface\fP option with interface name should be given.
\fIap\fP option can further concretize what AP should be used in case of WiFi
connection.  \fI\-\-nowait\fP option causes \fInmcli\fP to exit immediately and
not to wait for command completion.  \fI\-\-timeout\fP option provides a means
to specify how long to wait for operation completion.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP

method:    ActivateConnection
arguments: according to arguments
.fi
.TP
.B down id <id> | uuid <id>
.br

The connection is identified by its name using \fIid\fP
or UUID using \fIuuid\fP.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
